# 🚀 Spaceship Titanic – Kaggle Challenge

This repository contains my solution for the **Kaggle Spaceship Titanic** competition. 
The goal is to predict which passengers were transported to another dimension using machine learning models.

## 📌 Project Overview
- Dataset: Passenger details, cabin info, spending habits, and travel history.
- Approach: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and ML model training.
- Models Used: XGBoost, Random Forest, and other classifiers.
- Evaluation: Model tuning to improve accuracy.

## 🔍 Key Steps
✅ Data Cleaning & EDA  
✅ Feature Engineering  
✅ Model Training & Tuning  
✅ Predictions & Submission  

## 📂 Files
- `spaceship-titanic-ucs654.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with the full pipeline.
- `train.csv` & `test.csv` – Dataset files (from Kaggle).
- `submission.csv` – Final predictions for Kaggle leaderboard.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spaceship-titanic.git
   cd spaceship-titanic
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to train and generate predictions.
